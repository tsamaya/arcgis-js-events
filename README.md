## Instructions

You will need to install [Node](http://nodejs.org/), and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) in order to download dependencies and build the app via the command line.

1. [Fork and clone the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
2. `cd` into the `arcgis-js-events` folder
3. Run `npm install` to install the Grunt tasks
6. Run `grunt serve` to load the unbuilt app into a web browser
7. Modify the code as needed
8. Run `grunt build` to build the app under the `dist` folder

You can then browse to the `dist` folder to view the built app. You may want to run `grunt clean:deploy` to remove all uncompressed javascript and source maps before you deploy the contents of that folder to your web server.

## Requirements

* Notepad or your favorite text editor
* Web browser with access to the Internet
* [Node](http://nodejs.org/), and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to run the command line development tools
